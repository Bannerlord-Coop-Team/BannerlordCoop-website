title = "How battles/scenes will work ?"
content = "The current vision of the mod is to have separate parties. With this comes the issue of world map timing while in battle. There are multiple solutions to this, our solution to this is just to simply limit or slow time on the world map. Many have suggested to just have players in the same battle but that fix is not universal enough. For example, the game pauses time in a lot more situations than just battles, like visiting a town, in that case the other player would have no one to control or at least no point in controlling them. Our suggested fix will solve this by allowing all players to continue what they were doing in any scenario."
